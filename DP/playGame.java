Constraints:

    1 <= N <= 45

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An Integer N represents number of levels.
  
Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
2
  
Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation:
------------
1. 1-level+ 1-level =2
2. 2 levels in one step.
   
Sample Input-2:
---------------
4
  
Sample Output-2:
----------------
5

Explanation:
------------
1. 1-level + 1-level + 1-level + 1-level = 4
2. 1-level + 1-level + 2-levels = 4
3. 1-level + 2-levels + 1-level = 4
4. 2-levels + 1-level + 1-level = 4
5. 2-levels + 2-levels  = 4
